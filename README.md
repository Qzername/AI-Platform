# AI Platform

This repo consists of multiple projects containing diffrent models that I have worked on previosly or tools that help me share those models with everyone.

Here is detailed list of repo structure:
1. **AIPlatform** - The main website for running models in your browser. The project has not been created yet.
2. **AIPlatform.Bot** - A Discord bot that allows users to run models. For now, it contains temporary code because the AIPlatform website has not been created yet.
3. **AIPlatform.ModelConstruction** - Contains detailed data on how the model was made, with what code, what dataset, etc.
4. **AIPlatform.Models** - Contains all pre-trained models
