# Catgen

Catgen is a work-in-progress model that generates cat images.

# Structures

Due to the fact that my GPU (Intel Arc B580) is not well supported in tensorflow especially on Windows 11 machines, I was forced to move to PyTorch. 

Therefore, old_structure contains outdated dev-mk1 version of Gencat written in TensorFlow and if you are searching for actual code for the final model you should visit new_structure.
